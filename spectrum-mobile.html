    <h2>Techilla</h2>

    <p>The objective of the scavenger hunt is to present the participants with a list of clues/ riddles</p>
    <p><strong>Game plan logistics details:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the beginning, each of the seven teams will have to choose a sheet of paper randomly, which will assign to them their team number.</li>
      <li>This sheet shall contain the clue to their first location, which will be
    different for all the teams. Team 1 will be directed to location 1, team 2 to  location 2, and so on.</li>
      <li>The teams will move in an ordered manner, i.e., after completing the task at location 1, team 1 will be given the clue to location 2, team 2 will be given the location 3, and so on, and team 7 will be given the clue to location 1.</li>
      <li>At each site, 2 executives will be present, who will give the teams the clues bearing their respective team numbers. The teams will have to
    declare their team number at each location to get their next clue. </li>
      <li>Since the movement will be cyclic, site 1 will be the last location for team 2, site 2 will be the last location for team 3 and so on, and site 7 will be the last location for team 1. Then at location 1, all teams will get the clue to the next location, which will be location 3, except team 2, who will get the last puzzle (that of the constellation) here. This will apply to all sites.</li>
      <li>The teams will have to retain all the clues, with the answers to the tasks, when they move from one location to the next, to authenticate their presence at the particular location (that they did not just hit upon it). These clues will have to be shown at the NLHC when they reach there.</li>
      <li> Whichever team completes all the tasks and covers all the locations in the shortest time will be declared the winner. All tasks will need to be
    completed at the location itself, including the final task.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong><br>
    1 team per branch, consisting of 4 members each
